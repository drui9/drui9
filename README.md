```monospace
I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.
I loafe and invite my soul,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.

My tongue, every atom of my blood, formâ€™d from this soil, this air,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,
I, now `twenty-seven` years old in perfect health begin,
Hoping to cease not till death â€¦

        - Adapted from `Walt Whitman's` `Song of Myself`

Yours in the hope of eternal life:
